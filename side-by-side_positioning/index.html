  <h1>side-by-side positioning demo</h1>
  
<div class="red">
  <p>these two divs are positioned next to one another using <span>display: inline-block</span></p>
</div>
<div class="red2">
  <p>Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.</p>
</div>

<div class="green">
  <p>these are positioned using <span>float:left</span></p>
</div>

<div class="green2">
    <p>You can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...</p>

<div class="red3">
<p>What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%, right?</p>

      <p>if i do the same thing with floated elements....</p>

    <div class="green4">
    <p>The two elements are side-by-side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which, in this case, is the same as the width of the viewpor</p>
